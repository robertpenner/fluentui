This story demonstrates Stagger with an expandable container. The container smoothly grows and shrinks in height while items enter and exit with staggered animations.

Key features:

- First 2 items are always visible (static)
- Container expands first, then additional items enter via Stagger
- Items exit via Stagger (in reverse order), then container contracts
- Starting with 2 items, expanding to show all 8 items
- Coordinated timing between container resize and item animations

Useful for expandable lists, "show more" sections, and progressive disclosure interfaces.
